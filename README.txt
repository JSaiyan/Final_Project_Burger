Features
Our app is a burger menu app. The app displays a home page that takes a user to an order page or a order-summary page(2) end points right away. The order page will consist of a simple three burger menu with values set at 0 so when a user chooses an item(burger) they will input a number greater than 0. 
Form spoof proofed. 
The delivery details inputs are set values from the database to be specific so phone number and zip codes will have to be numbers. This page has client and server side Validation. After the radio payment methods selected the submit order will take the user to a confirmation page, third(3) endpoint. 
The menu limitations are limited to three items only and payment methods are limited.
